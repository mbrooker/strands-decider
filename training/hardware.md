# Hardware notes (24 GiB)

Measured on an RTX 3090 with Qwen3-1.7B (v7's torso), `max_length` 1024, 40 optimizer
steps each; the Qwen3.5 figures follow in their own subsection.

These numbers still hold at the current 4096 default. The collator pads to the longest
sequence in each batch, not to `max_length`, and the corpus is short — median 204
tokens, p99 634, longest 1811 — so only ~0.15% of examples are affected by the cap at
all and no batch grows. Raising `max_length` is an inference-side change in practice;
it costs p95 latency, not training time.

| micro-batch | grad accum | checkpointing | throughput | peak VRAM |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **8** | **4** | **on** | **9.6 ex/s** | **5.8 GiB** |
| 16 | 2 | on | 9.3 ex/s | 6.7 GiB |
| 32 | 1 | on | 7.7 ex/s | 9.9 GiB |
| 8 | 4 | off | 1.6 ex/s | 36.3 GiB |

Two results worth internalising before you tune anything:

**Leave gradient checkpointing on.** Turning it off asks for 36 GiB, and on Windows
that does not fail cleanly — WDDM silently spills the excess to host memory over
PCIe, and the run gets *6× slower* while still appearing to work. The loss curve is
identical either way (1.4087 at step 40 in both), so this is purely a memory/speed
trade and checkpointing wins it outright on this card.

**A bigger micro-batch does not help.** The GPU is already compute-bound at 100%
utilisation and ~380 W with micro-batch 8; larger batches only add memory pressure.
The headroom is there for a longer `max_length` or a larger torso, not a wider batch.

v7's corpus (97,432 training rows, 1 epoch, effective batch 32) is 3,044 optimizer
steps, 3.0 h.

## The Qwen3.5 torso (v13-v19)

Both trained under WSL2 with the fused linear-attention kernels ([Setup](README.md#setup)).

| | corpus | steps | throughput | peak VRAM | one epoch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| v13 | 97k classification rows | 3,044 | 0.28 steps/s | 6.2 GiB | 3.1 h |
| v14 | + 12.9k multi-step rows (~1.6k tokens on average) | 3,436 | 0.19 steps/s | 12.4 GiB | ~5 h |
| v18 | + 3.8k generated document questions (~1,000-word documents) | 3,551 | 0.17 steps/s | 12.4 GiB | ~5.5 h |
| v19 | + 6.2k answer-adequacy rows | 3,738 | 0.17 steps/s | 12.4 GiB | ~6 h |

The multi-step rows add about as many tokens as the whole classification corpus, which
is where v14's extra time and memory go. Labelling them with the 4B teacher took 55
minutes. On Windows' fallback kernels the same labelling spilled past the 24 GiB and
slowed to a crawl: the labeller writes each row as it goes and resumes, and its default
batch budget is 4,000 tokens for that reason.

## Allocator fragmentation under WSL2 (hobson-bidi)

Length-grouped batches change shape every step, and torch's default caching allocator
fragments under that. On the T5Gemma 2 torso (b1) it reserved 22.4 GB for a 15.4 GiB
allocation peak. With the Windows compositor holding 9.2 GB more, that went past the
card, and under WSL2 the overflow spills to system memory over PCIe rather than
failing. The run stalled at step 40 with copy traffic visible, while still appearing to
work. `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` reserves close to the peak
(3.38 against 4.64 GiB on a mixed-size test) and works under WSL2. It is the default in
`strands_decider.cli` and `training/recipe.sh`, and an explicit setting overrides it.
Windows' per-process figure is the "Dedicated GPU memory" column in Task Manager's
Details tab; the WSL VM shows there as `vmwp`. `nvidia-smi` cannot attribute GPU use to
WSL processes.

## Length-grouped batching

The collator pads each micro-batch to its longest row, so one long document among
short ones makes all eight rows pay for it. `group_by_length: true` (on in both
configs, off in code so every saved `train_config.json` still reproduces its run)
shuffles the corpus, sorts within megabatches of 400 rows, slices those into
micro-batches and shuffles the batches — the standard scheme, as in HuggingFace's
option of the same name. Measured in tokens:

| corpus | padding, ungrouped | grouped | padded tokens saved |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| v7 (`train_v5.jsonl`) | 41.9% | 18.4% | 1.41x |
| v10 (v7 + 20k long documents) | 57.9% | 15.8% | 2.00x |
| v14 (v7 + 12.9k multi-step rows) | 74.6%* | 6.1%* | |

\* measured in prompt characters, the unit the sampler sorts by; token padding runs
higher, especially grouped.

At these lengths the linear layers dominate, so expect wall clock to follow the last
column roughly; it has not been timed on a full run. It is not strictly free: batches
become length-homogeneous, and length correlates with task. Sorting only within
megabatches keeps long documents spread across the whole epoch rather than bunched
into consecutive steps — which would be a different training distribution — and
`tests/test_sampling.py` enforces that. The longest batch runs first, so an
out-of-memory failure shows at step 1 rather than hours in.

## Larger torsos

Measured for Qwen3-4B, projected beyond it from those two points. Weights are exact
(2 bytes/param); activations barely move with model size once checkpointing is on
(fitted 2.47 x params^0.09 at micro-batch 8), so **weights are the binding constraint**.

| torso | weights | activations | peak @ mb=8 | throughput | 1 epoch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.7B | 3.2 GiB | 2.6 GiB | **5.8 GiB** (measured) | 9.6 ex/s | 1.2 h |
| 4B | 7.5 GiB | 2.8 GiB | **10.3 GiB** (measured) | 5.1 ex/s | 2.2 h |
| 8B | 15.3 GiB | ~3.0 GiB | ~18.3 GiB | ~3.0 ex/s | ~3.8 h |
| 14B | 27.5 GiB | ~3.2 GiB | ~30.7 GiB — **does not fit** | — | — |

14B is a hard wall, not a tight squeeze: its weights alone exceed the ~23 GiB usable,
so no batch size or sequence length recovers it. Going beyond 8B needs 4-bit QLoRA
(14B weights drop to ~7.5 GiB) — but 4-bit degrades exactly the probability
calibration the confidence scores depend on, so measure ECE before trusting it.

Throughput scales as params^-0.75, not linearly — larger torsos are cheaper than a
naive FLOP count suggests.
